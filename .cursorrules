# Code Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. EASY TO CHANGE
   - Keep components loosely coupled
   - Use dependency injection where possible
   - Avoid hardcoding values - use config.yml
   - Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility

2. SIMPLICITY
   - Favor composition over inheritance
   - Keep functions focused and small (single responsibility, under 50 lines)
   - Use descriptive names over comments
   - Minimize state management complexity

3. CONSISTENCY
   - Follow existing patterns for new components
   - Use dataclasses for data models
   - Keep CLI interface consistent across components
   - Maintain similar file structure in each component

## Code Style
- Type hints are required
- Use dataclasses for data models
- Respect ruff and mypy rules in pyproject.toml
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful variable names

## Error Handling
- Use custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Fail fast and explicitly
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Configuration
- All configurable values belong in config.yml
- Environment variables for secrets only
- Use strong typing for config values
- Document all configuration options

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Pin dependency versions
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Documentation
- READMEs should explain component purpose
- Document non-obvious design decisions
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update docs when changing interfaces

## Data Flow
- Use typed models for data transfer
- Validate data at boundaries
- Keep data transformations explicit
- Log important state changes

## Security
- Validate all external inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Follow principle of least privilege
