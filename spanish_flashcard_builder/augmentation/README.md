# Vocabulary augmentation

This step of the pipeline enriches vocabulary terms with additional learning context using OpenAI. It looks through the existing output directory for terms with Merriam-Webster dictionary entry JSON generated by the `vocab_selector` step. If the term doesn't already have an augmented term file, it will use OpenAI to generate a new one.

## Usage

Run the augmentation tool using the package's CLI:
```bash
sfb augment
```
