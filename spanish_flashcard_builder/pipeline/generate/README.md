# AI Content Generation

This step of the pipeline enriches vocabulary terms with additional learning context using OpenAI. It looks through the existing output directory for terms with Merriam-Webster dictionary entry JSON generated by the `curate` step. If the term doesn't already have a generated content file, it will use OpenAI to create a new one.

## Usage

Run the generation tool using the package's CLI:
```bash
sfb generate
```
